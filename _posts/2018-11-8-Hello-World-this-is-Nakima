WHO ARE YOU?
Hello guys, my name is Nakima S.D. Slaughter in I'm 16 years old. In I was born in Dallas,Texas.
I go to Franklin D. Roosevelt in I attend the Collegiate Academy.I wanted to be in the collegiate cause I think its a good thing and you can get ahead.
Before High School started for me my mom gave names of schools,I just said this school.
I go to the same school my parents went but my mom left in went to a school in North Dallas.
So I'm the youngest out of my mom kids in she just had two kids.
My daddy only had me in I'm happy with that because I can get all the things I want and I'm a daddy's baby too.
I do track in field but I always liked it, I did it when I was young in I had stop for like a year.
But yes I'm doing it now I go to practice the days I can if nothing else happen, also I be practicing with the cross country kids in I know he gone want me to run a meet most likely the last meet like last year.
I don't work but I cut yards on the weekends from time to time if its not raining.
To me I like cutting its fun to do, its easy that means when I have my own house I'm not gone need nobody to do my yard.
I'm a little scared of the weed eaters I'm going to end up knowing how to do it just not now.
Lastly, out of no where I told my parents I wanted to get braces in they let me get them on the 7th of September.

#WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?#
The reason I'm here is because I wanted to be in this program its good to do things like this.
In when you go to college after you graduate you will already know whats going on when you go and you just gone have 2 years left but it depends on what you gone be I think.
All the work I do is going to be easy if I just pay attention stay focus at all times.
You have to make good grades because at no point of wasting time you should past everything now so you don't have to weary about doing this again or later.
Since I been in this program I been learning new things I didn't know, and I'm not gone lie last year I didn't pay attention sometimes but this year I changed I got to focus for real.
My parents teach me the right things that's why I am who I am.
I am going to be successful.I am glad that I'm here. How about y'all?
That's good they put the collegiate in some of the schools I hear people say they wish they had this opportunity.
Okay now,lastly my family happy that I'm doing this and I wanted to do this.

WHO I ADMIRE?

The people I admire is my mother,father, and sister because they raising me right.Without them I wouldn't be me today I thank them for that. I really love my family I have good parents they make sure everything is okay.They are smart and strong people.But there are several people who have influenced various aspects of my life.How tired they be they still have time to do what they have to do for me.They is a large hero and the most important people in my life.

THE REASON WHY I LIKE SHOES?

Cause when I was little I use to take people shoes in hide them. That's probably why I like shoes a lot cause I stay getting shoes when I can.I wear different nice shoes if I like it I'ma get it.For some reason I don't like wearing the same shoe everyday in sometimes when I don't wear the shoe in a while they think its new but its not.

ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS!

Hey again,I'm a good and quiet girl,I really talk when I want to.I think i'm a little shy but I don't like being around a lot of people.I think some of the things I do I got from my daddy and mother.I like to listen to music and I listen to a lot of stuff like old , new, everything.I don't like being around loud people that's loud for nothing.I'm not a fighting type of person but if I have to I will.I have little feet that's all I hear from people and they say my head big but some say its little.My life has been quite peaceful because of the ability to understand situations.Also i'm a goofy person I try to make people happy when they sad or not.Y'all know in life, you come across many challenge.Well I think leadership is a person who guides or inspires others within an organization.People say that I be mean to people but to me I be talking the truth , whats on my mind.What I hate is when people be talking to me in I don't be talking to them.Also just be taping on me for no reason.In I like when my family tell me stories of how I was when I was little it be funny to me.They say I grew up to fast.I would like to speak different languages like now i'm doing Spanish now i'm not got at it at all.To me life is beautiful.Each in every day I try to do better then the days before.I'ma keep my grades up and have no 70's on my report card.My parents don't have to weary about me because I respect them and what they do in say to me.I'm not no disrespectful person because I was raised right.

THE END!
